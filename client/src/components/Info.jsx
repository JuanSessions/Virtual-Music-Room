            <p>It’s a website dedicated to collaborations between musicians/producers from their own houses or studios. 
                The artist can be part of a single project or part of a steady band that stays active in the platform with every member adding their own instrument and tracks to the projects. 
                <br/>
                We also provide services like technical support to help the users upload their tracks in the best way possible and free templates to help them display their material in a professional way. 
            </p>

            <h3>THERE’S A UNIQUE FEATURE TOO:</h3>

            <p>The virtual room offers a visit to the studio/rehearsal room and gives access to the mix of the song/soundtrack. 
            They can locate themselves at any point in the room controlling the mix of the different instruments according to the position of the guest in the room.
                <br/>
               In the homepage you’ll find an example for a standard/4pieces band, but other shapes of rooms for trios, 
                bigger bands, etc. It’s technically possible.
            </p>

            <h3>Live jam sessions in the next future</h3>
            <p>With the proper WiFi infrastructure the virtual visits to the room can be done during 
                live jam sessions with all the artists playing LIVE remotely and the interesting and unique
                 option for the guests to control the volumes of the mix positioning themselves in the room.
                  This way the user can focus in a particular performance to connect and possibly work together
                   with those specific artists that are performing and actually check how they can improvise, etc.
                There's already in USA a zone between a couple of cities where the live jams WITHOUT LATENCY is 
                possible. This is Germany and the infrastructure is going to be here soon probably.
